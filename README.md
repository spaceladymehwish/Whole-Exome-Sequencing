# Whole Exome Sequencing
 1. Sample Preparation
Extract high-quality DNA from the sample.
Shear the DNA into smaller fragments.
Add adapters to the DNA fragments to enable sequencing.
2. Exome Capture
Use target enrichment techniques to selectively capture the protein-coding regions (exons) of the genome.
Common methods include array-based hybrid capture and in-solution capture using biotinylated RNA or DNA probes.
3. Library Preparation
Prepare the sequencing library by amplifying the captured exonic regions.
Add sample-specific barcodes or indexes to enable multiplexing of samples.
4. Sequencing
Load the prepared library onto a high-throughput sequencing platform, such as Illumina or Ion Torrent.
Generate millions of short sequencing reads covering the targeted exonic regions.
5. Sequence Alignment
Map the sequencing reads to a reference genome using a bioinformatics tool like BWA or Bowtie.
This step aligns the reads to their corresponding positions in the genome.
6. Variant Calling
Identify genetic variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions) in the aligned reads compared to the reference genome.
Use variant calling tools like GATK or Samtools to identify and genotype the variants.
7. Variant Annotation
Annotate the identified variants with information about their potential functional impact, such as amino acid changes, regulatory effects, and population frequencies.
Tools like SnpEff, VEP, or Annovar can be used for this step.
8. Variant Prioritization
Prioritize the variants based on their potential relevance to the disease or phenotype of interest.
Consider factors like variant frequency, predicted functional impact, and association with known disease genes.
9. Data Interpretation
Analyze the prioritized variants to determine their potential role in the disease or phenotype.
Integrate the variant information with other relevant data, such as gene function, biological pathways, and clinical phenotypes.
10. Validation
Validate the findings by orthogonal methods, such as Sanger sequencing or targeted genotyping.
Confirm the identified variants and their potential impact on the disease or phenotype.
This step-by-step workflow ensures that whole exome sequencing data is thoroughly analyzed and interpreted to identify genetic variants that may be relevant to the research or clinical question at hand.
